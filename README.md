## Empowering Women and Fostering Inclusivity in the Workplace

### Inspiration
As women and promoters of women in workplaces, we've faced negativity firsthand. HateMiner was created to combat hurtful comments targeting women in the workplace. By promoting respect and inclusivity, we aim to empower women and foster a welcoming environment in every community, ensuring everyone can thrive regardless of gender.

### What it Does
HateMiner is a tool that detects and flags hateful comments targeting women or a specific community. It analyzes text messages, warns senders of their behavior, and notifies administrators of severe cases. Integrated into platforms like Discord and web platforms, it aids HR by tracking and managing inappropriate behavior, fostering a more inclusive tech environment. It will be of great use.

### How it Works
HateMiner utilizes advanced models like SVM and BERT for hate speech detection. Text messages are analyzed, and if flagged, the sender is warned. Severe cases are escalated to administrators. Employee profiles track flagged messages for HR, aiding in managing workplace behavior.
